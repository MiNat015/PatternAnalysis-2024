# Generating Synthetic Brain Scans with StyleGAN (COMP3710)

This project implements StyleGAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to create high-quality, synthetic
brain scan images. Developed as part of the COMP3710 course, this implementation aims to demonstrate
the potential of deep learning in medical imaging synthesis.
